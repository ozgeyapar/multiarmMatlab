UNDER PDECORR FOLDER: These files are created to adapt the code in pdestop to calculate the EVI for a correlation problem, they are used together with pdestop code to calculate cPDE.

UNDER POLICIES FOLDER: These files are used to calculate allocation and stopping decisions.
- AllocationBasedonEVI.m: Takes the EVI approximations as an input and returns an arm to be sampled from.
- AllocationTieBreaker.m: Used to break the ties when an allocation policy estimates the same EVI for multiple arms.
- Allocation*.m (except above two) returns the allocation decision provided by the allocation policy implied by the name of the file. If the allocation policy is EVI-based, there are two arguments that control randomization. If randtype == 1, uniform randomization is used and If randtype == 2, TTVS is used. And randprob contorls the probability of randomization (p in the paper).
- Stopping*.m returns the stopping decision provided by the stopping policy implied by the name of the file.
- cKG*.m, cPDE*.m returns the EVI values using the approximation method implied in the name.

UNDER SIM FOLDER: These files are related to the Monte Carlo Simulation.
- SetParametersFunc.m: Creates a struct array which includes the problem parameters
-- CheckParameters.m: Checks the validity of parameters that is created by SetParametersFunc.m

- SimSetupandRunFunc.m: Main file that runs the simulation replications for a given problem.
-- SimulationFunc.m: Runs one simulation replication.
-- TrueThetaCreator.m: Generates the ground truth to be used in the simulation replication based on problem parameters.
-- DefineRules.m: A macro to define funciton handles for allocation policies and stopping times as function handles
-- AssignPolicyNames.m: Generates a name for allocation policy or stopping time to be used in legends, tables etc.

- SimPilotandDetPrior.m: Simulates a pilot dose-response data from the true theta and actual sampling variance, uses this data to estimate a prior distribution using Algorithm 2 of Chick, Gans, Yapar (2020)
-- GPRFit.m: Implements the 'Fit' stage of Algorithm 2 of Chick, Gans, Yapar (2020). 
-- GPRAltFit.m: Implements the 'Alternative Fit' stage of Algorithm 2 of Chick, Gans, Yapar (2020).
